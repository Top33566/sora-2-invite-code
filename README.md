<h1>Sora 2 Invite Code Method</h1>

  <p>
    Sora 2 just launched, and many people are asking how to get an invite code. 
    The app is new, invite-only, and not everyone can join right away. 
    If you are here, you likely want to try it before others, see what it can do, and share videos with friends.

  <p>
    Sora 2 is OpenAI’s new video and audio tool. 
    It is linked with a social app that looks like TikTok but with AI-made clips. 
    Because access is limited, invite codes are the only way in right now. 
    You can <a href="https://urlgo.in/sora2code" target="_blank">get your working invite code here</a> if slots are still open.

  <h2>What is Sora 2?</h2>

  <p>
    Sora 2 is the latest, highly advanced text-to-video and audio generation AI model developed by OpenAI. 
    It can create short, realistic video clips with sound, dialogue, and movement that follow the rules of physics. 
    For example, a ball bounces off the backboard instead of teleporting into the hoop. 
    This makes the results more natural than older AI video models.

  <h2>How the Sora 2 App Works</h2>

  <p>
    The Sora app, which works like TikTok or Instagram Reels, is built around Sora 2. 
    In the app, you can swipe through an endless feed of AI-made videos, create your own, and even appear in them using a feature called cameos. 
    You can <a href="https://urlgo.in/sora2code" target="_blank">claim your Sora 2 code here</a> to try it early.

  <p>
    Access is invite-only, meaning you need a unique six-character code (letters and numbers). 
    Each code can only be used to create two accounts, so don’t share yours publicly.

  <h2>Why You Need a Code</h2>

  <p>
    OpenAI is gradually expanding access to Sora 2 to control demand and test new features.
